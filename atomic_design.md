## Atomic Design

A way to think Design Systems that breaks down everything to really simple levels (atoms). It breaks the Design System in 5 different parts (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages).

### atom 
the tiniest little unit that can exist on its own.
it can be a label, an input, a button.

### molecule
It is a combination of atoms that are used to build something meaningful.
It can be the combination of the former elements, in order to form a search field.

### organism
It is the combination of several atoms and molecules. It is a larger structure that can make sense for the user.
It can be a nav bar composed of a search field along side with navigation links and a logo. Another example of an organism is a blog post, a footer.

The larger the structure more meaning it gets.

### templates and pages
Combination of different organisms in order to make sense together.
A login page is a example of a template. It combines a form, a button, maybe a heading, a card.
The main difference between a template and a page is the data used in it. A templeta uses mock and placeholder data, while the page uses real data.
The template is a representation of what the page would be.
