# CSS Architecture

A Design System should have a maintanable and scalable code base, and this starts with on how we write our styles.

## CSS Architecture Checklist

- Organised - fixed code structure, fixed guide lines and a consistent codebase
- No specificity issues, no conflicting styles
- Atomic design principles - even if it is just the folder structure, it already helps to better organize the css codebase.
- Easy to understande (comments, variables)
- Fully customizable and themeable
- Reusable across teams and projects
